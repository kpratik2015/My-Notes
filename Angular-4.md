# Angular 4 from Scratch

Download [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) which has npm package.

After installing check in cmd with command: node -v 

As of today states: v8.11.3

Then run some commands: (Before running check if you have installed by running: ng -v)

_Note: -g is for global. That is, you have to only run it once and not everytime you start a project_
```
cd to code folder.

ng new project-name

cd project-name

ng -v
```

_Now ng -v provides versions of all the things angular installed_

Now make sure you have typescript installed > v2.16. If not, do the following:

```
npm install typescript@2.2.1 --save

ng - v

ng serve --open

```
