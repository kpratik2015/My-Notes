/**
Object created by the Object constructor inherits from the constructor's prototype. 
Additionally, it runs the constructor function as well.

On the other hand, Object.create() builds an object that inherits directly from the one passed as its first argument. 
It doesnâ€™t have any constructor to run. 
Closure cannot be created as it follows the functional syntax.
